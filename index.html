                            Hi there. I’m a second-year PhD student in Information Studies at the University of Maryland’s College of Information Studies (iSchool). 
                            I conduct human-computer interaction (HCI) research in the context of multilingual communication. 
                            I use mixed methods to understand how language technology can be used and designed to support people’s use of their full linguistic repertoire across linguistic boundaries for self-expression and communication with others. 
                            
                        </p>
                        <p id="main-text">
                            I have a multidisciplinary educational background connecting my interests in linguistic practices and information technology. 
                            Prior to Maryland, I obtained my MS in Applied Data Science and MA in Linguistic Studies with a graduate certificate in Language Teaching from Syracuse University, 
                            and BM(anagement) in Information Management and System and BA in English with a minor in Finance from Shanghai International Studies University (SISU). 
                            I spent a wonderful semester as an international visiting student in management information systems at the University of North Carolina Wilmington.

                        </p>
                        <p id="main-text">
                            Outside work, I enjoy exploring the external world and my inner self. 
                            I read, walk, cook, binge watch TV shows, and express myself through writing, art, photos and conversations with friends. 
                            I'm from Ganzhou, China and used to live in Shanghai and Syracuse, NY before moving to Maryland. 
                            I speak Mandarin and English, very often a mixture of them, and can understand my family language, Hakka Chinese (Ganzhou area).
                            I can be reached at yxiao[at]umd[dot]com.
