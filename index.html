                            Hello. I'm a second-year PhD student in Information Studies at the University of Maryland's
                            College of Information Studies (iSchool).
                            I conduct research at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and multilingual communication. 
                            My work seeks to understand how people leverage their linguistic repertoire for communicative and social purposes 
                            and design technology to support communication across linguistic boundaries.
                        </p>
                        <p id="main-text">
                            Prior to Maryland, I obtained my MS in Applied Data Science,
                            MA in Linguistic Studies, and CAS in Language Teaching from Syracuse University, and 
                            BM(anagement) in Information Management and System and BA in English with a minor in Finance
                            from Shanghai International Studies University (SISU).
                            I spent a wonderful semester as an international visiting student at the University of North Carolina Wilmington.
                        
                        </p>
                        <p id="main-text">
                            I spend much of my time following my curiosity for both inward and outward exploration.
                            I read, walk, journal, experience and create art, and every once in a while, nap, to be ready for new adventures. 
                            I document my heartfelt life journey through language and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yiminxpics/">photos</a>.

                        <p id="main-text">
                            Feel free to drop me an email at yxiao [at] umd [dot] edu to chat about research or life. 
                            I can communicate in Mandarin and English, or a mixture of both. 
                            I would also love to hear Hakka (Ganzhou area) Chinese with it being my family language, though sadly I can hardly speak it.
