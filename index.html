                            Hi there. I’m a third-year PhD candidate in Information Studies at the University of Maryland’s College of Information Studies. 
                            My research focuses on human-computer interaction (HCI) and computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) in contexts of language diversity. 
                            I apply social science theories and mixed methods to examine human's communicative agency when their interpersonal communications are mediated by language technologies such as machine translation and large language models.
                        <p id="main-text">
                            I have a multidisciplinary educational background connecting my interests in language and informaiton technology. 
                            Prior to Maryland, I obtained my MS in Applied Data Science and MA in Linguistic Studies with a graduate certificate in Language Teaching from Syracuse University. 
                            I completed my undergraduate studies at Shanghai International Studies University (<span class="CH">上海外国语大学</span>, SISU) with a BM(anagement) in Information Management and System, BA in English, and a minor in Finance. 
                            I also spent a wonderful semester as an international visiting student in management information systems at the University of North Carolina Wilmington during my undergrad.

                            I enjoy many other things outside work. 
                            My current obsessions are knitting and crocheting. I keep finding beutiful patterns that I want to make things from, and sometimes I design patterns myself as well.
                            When I do take a break from yarn work or shopping around a yarn store, I also <a href='read.html'>read</a>, write, journal, walk, cook, bake, visit museums, sketch, enjoy good TV shows, and photograph my life. 
                            I'm from Ganzhou <span class="CH">赣州</span>, China and have lived in Shanghai and Syracuse, NY before moving to the DMV area.
                            I can be reached at yxiao[at]umd[dot]edu.
